# GPT-5.2 Optimization Instructions for GitHub Copilot

## Behavioral Guidelines
- Provide concise responses without preambles or status updates
- Only make changes directly requested - no scope expansion
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Never provide time estimates

## GPT-5.2 Weak Points to Compensate For
- CONCURRENCY: Review all async/await code for race conditions (6x more bugs than other models)
- SCOPE CREEP: Stick strictly to what was asked
- VERBOSITY: Keep code minimal

## Code Standards
- TypeScript with strict typing (no `any`)
- Functional components with hooks
- Early returns for error handling
- Delete unused code completely

## React Native / Mobile
- Use TouchableOpacity inside ScrollView (not Pressable on Android)
- Wrap Pressable backgrounds in parent View
- Use theme tokens for all colors
- Test light and dark mode
- Dark mode buttons: #333333

## Git
- Stage specific files only
- Never amend unless asked
- Never force push
- Descriptive commit messages

## After Changes
- Update TECHNICAL_MANUAL.md with version/changelog
- Update CLAUDE.md with new patterns
